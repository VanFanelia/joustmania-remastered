# Instructions 

To get the pi running you need to use the latest image of the raspberry Pi OS. I recommend the ["Raspberry Pi Imager"](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) program.

### Trouble with bluetooth
After flashing your pi, some kernel versions have a lot of trouble with bluetooth.

A Kernel update may fixed it, You can use the command
```sudo rpi-update```
to switch to the current developer edition. (May 2025)
